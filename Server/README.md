# SnapCrack 
SnapCrack is an Android application that is capable of crack detection and localization in real time.  This application leverages basic object detection algorithms to detect cracks.  After a crack has been detected, an image will be stored and sent to a database where further analysis can be conducted on the dataset.  This repository contains this application aswell as tools for modifying the dataset, training the object detector, and demoing the object detector in real time.
